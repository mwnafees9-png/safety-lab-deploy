/* ============================================================================
 * severity_tables.js — v1.0 — the failure-condition SEVERITY TABLE per certification
 * basis, as the authority printed it, for the reference table on the certification
 * basis page and the Definitions exports (3 Oct 2026).
 *
 * WHY (Waqas, 3 Oct 2026): "I want these definitions to match part 23/25 or whatever
 * part the cert basis dictates, why is the CAT definition with more context than the
 * rest?" The page table was hard-coded to the Part 25 wording (AC 25.1309-1B Table 4-1)
 * whatever the basis, with a one-off note under Catastrophic only, and the same fixed
 * wording was copied into two exports. Now ONE data set per basis drives the page and
 * both exports, every class row is built the same way, and a basis' own notes sit in
 * one footnote list under the table, each labeled with its source.
 *
 * v1.1 3 Oct 2026: the rotorcraft citations named the wrong section of the AC (1309A, the
 * lightning-only amendment). The figure belongs to AC 27.1309B (Amendment 27-51) and AC 29.1309B
 * (Amendment 29-59). The cell wording was already right and is unchanged.
 * SOURCES, checked against the documents on 3 Oct 2026:
 *   · Part 25: FAA AC 25.1309-1B (30 Aug 2024) Table 4-1 and §3.1.5 Notes — US Government
 *     work, public domain, VERBATIM.
 *   · Part 23: FAA AC 23.1309-1E (11/17/2011) Figure 2 and ¶8.x(5) Notes — public domain,
 *     VERBATIM. The class (I–IV) changes the numbers and DALs, never these words.
 *   · Part 27: FAA AC 27-1B Chg 9 (6/23/23), AC 27.1309B (§27.1309 Amendment 27-51),
 *     Figure AC 27.1309-2 — public domain, VERBATIM.
 *   · Part 29: FAA AC 29-2C Chg 9 (6/23/23), AC 29.1309B (§29.1309 Amendment 29-59),
 *     Figure AC 29.1309-2 — public domain, VERBATIM (as printed, including "or safety" in
 *     the Minor cell).
 *   · SC-VTOL: EASA MOC SC-VTOL Issue 2 (12 May 2021), MOC VTOL.2510, Failure Conditions
 *     Classifications and Table 1 — EASA text is not reproduced: SUMMARY with the section
 *     reference (Waqas, 3 Oct 2026: a summary is acceptable). EASA prints definitions, not
 *     an effect table, so the summary is laid out in the same columns.
 *   · Part 33: 14 CFR §33.75(g) and (a)(3)–(4) (eCFR, current 1 Oct 2026) — VERBATIM.
 *   · Part 35: 14 CFR §35.15(g) and (a)(3) (eCFR, current 1 Oct 2026) — VERBATIM.
 *   · Part 450 / Part 107 and Custom: no five-class table; the page says so plainly.
 *
 * This is DISPLAY data. It is NOT the AI's classification rubric (severity_rubrics.js),
 * which is AI-facing text and only changes through the eval. Pure: no DOM except the
 * render() helper, no RNG, no Date. See tests/regression_severity_tables_20261003.test.js.

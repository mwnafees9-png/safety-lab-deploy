/* ============================================================================
 * severity_rubrics.js — the failure-condition SEVERITY DEFINITIONS per cert basis,
 * as the authority wrote them, for ANEM's classification passes.
 *
 * WHY (Waqas, 31 Aug 2026): "the AI assistant needs all these standards too, it
 * will help it with severity determinations." Until now the analysis context
 * carried the basis NAME and the per-flight-hour TARGETS (safety_targets.js), but
 * never the definitions a severity is decided against — so an FHA pass classified
 * from background knowledge, and background knowledge is Part 25. A Basic-category
 * eVTOL, a Class I Part 23 airplane and a transport all got the same instincts.
 *
 * This module is DETERMINISTIC DATA: one rubric per cert-basis family, resolved by
 * rubricFor(certBasisKey) and injected by ai_assistant._assembleAnalysisContext for
 * every feature that assigns or reviews a severity (_SEVERITY_FEATURES). Pure,
 * no DOM, no RNG, no Date. Loaded right after safety_targets.js.
 *
 * COPYRIGHT POSTURE (same three-way split as cert_std_kb_data.js):
 *   · FAA AC 25.1309-1B (30 Aug 2024) and AC 23.1309-1E — US Government works,
 *     PUBLIC DOMAIN: definitions quoted VERBATIM from the PDFs fetched from
 *     faa.gov on 31 Aug 2026 (paragraph numbers are the AC's own).
 *   · 14 CFR §33.75 + AC 33.75-1A Chg 1, and 14 CFR §35.15 — public domain, quoted
 *     verbatim from eCFR / faa.gov (31 Aug 2026).
 *   · EASA MOC SC-VTOL Issue 2 (12 May 2021) MOC VTOL.2510 §7(a) — free to read,
 *     not US-Gov public domain: CITE AND POINT, facts and section refs only.
 *   · FAA AC 27-1B Chg 4 (AC 27.1309 f.(1)) and AC 29-2C Chg 4 (AC 29.1309 b.(2),
 *     Figure AC 29.1309-2) — public domain, quoted verbatim from the consolidated
 *     PDFs fetched from faa.gov on 31 Aug 2026 (v2; v1 carried a placeholder).
 *
 * DRIFT DISCIPLINE: tests/regression_severity_rubrics.test.js pins the verbatim
 * FAA sentences here against cert_std_kb_data.js (same source, same words) and
 * pins the class list against SEVERITY_RANK — the rubric can never name a
 * severity the engine does not rank.
